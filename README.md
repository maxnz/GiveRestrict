# GiveRestrict
A simple Spigot plugin adding a permission to `/give` for each Minecraft item.

Allow your users to harness the power of `/give`, but limit what they can get.
Each and every Minecraft item (as of 1.15.2) has a permission assigned to it.
Using a permissions plugin, you can permit users to `/give` themself a specific item, such as food or a tool, but not others, like an enchanted golden apple.
